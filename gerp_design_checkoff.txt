Answer the questions below, and submit your answers under the assignment
"gerp Design Checkoff" on Gradescope. You must sign up for a design checkoff
slot with a TA to discuss your provided answers (see spec for sign up link).
Make sure to submit this file *prior* to your design checkoff.

For each question, give as much detail as you feel is necessary.

1. What classes and structs will you implement for your program? For each class,
   provide a list of public functions of that class; for each struct, provide a
   list of member variables.

Answer:
        
2. Describe the index that you will build for querying. What specific data
   structures will you use to build this index? *Important*: Bring an
   accompanying drawing of your index structure when you come to your checkoff.

Answer:

3. To use your index, you will use something for lookup (the key) and you will
   get some associated data back (the value). What are the C++ *types* of your
   index's key and value? Examples of valid types: int, string,
   vector<string>, vector<list<string>>; you may also define custom types using
   structs/classes, e.g., Animal and vector<Animal> are valid types if you
   define a struct/class named Animal. If your key/value types involve custom
   classes/structs, they should be included in your answer to question #1.
                
Answer:

   Key type:
   Value type:         

4. Explain what a collision is versus having multiple lines associated with 
   a particular word. Write (and/or draw) out an example of when a 
   collision occurs. Write (and/or draw) out an example of when multiple 
   lines associated with a single word. 

Answer:

5. What do you expect the *space* complexity of your index will be? How many
   times will a single line be stored according to your data structures?

Answer:

6. What is the time complexity of *building* your index? If you refer to some
   variable, be sure to specify what the variable refers to, e.g., in "O(n)",
   state explicitly what "n" is.

Answer:
                
7. What is the time complexity of *using* your index for lookup? As above,
   be specific about variables you use.

Answer:

8. How will you handle case-sensitive search?
   What is the time complexity (should be close to O(1))?

Answer:

9. How will you handle case-insensitive search?
   What is the time complexity (should be close to O(1))?

Answer:

10. How are you handling duplicate words within a line? Consider these two example 
   lines: 

      (i) the cat and the dog 
      (ii) the cat and THE dog 

   If a user does a case sensitive query on line (i) it should report 'the' only 
   once by showing the line only once in the output. How will you do this? 

   If a user does a case insensitive query on line (ii) it should report 'the' 
   only once by showing the line only once in the output. How will you do this? 

Answer:

11. How will you test your implementation and what specific evidence of testing
    will you submit?

Answer:

12. What is your schedule for completing this assignment? Include specific dates
    and the tasks that you would like to accomplish by each date. Do not forget
    testing!
